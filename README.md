# License-Detection-using-QR-Code
We have implemented a system which checks whether the License is authorized or un-authorized.
In this system, we generate a QR code and can enter the data of applicant and generate new QR code.
We can scan this QR code through webcam/ mobile phone to retrieve the data present in QR code, 
if data retrieved in scanner app and data in the csv file mismatches or not present then we can 
conclude that the license belongs to an un-authorized person

To build this project: 
1. The Python libraries â€“ pyzbar, PIL, pillow, pyqrcode, opencv-python,tabulate,csv etc. was used in the system. 
2. Using pyqrcode, QR code were generated with the data. 
3. IP webcam application was used for scanning purpose.

Python Libraries Installation:
pip install pillow
pip install pyqrcode
pip install pypng
pip install pyzbar
pip install PIL
pip install opencv-python
